TalkTyper
=================

This is a plugin for DrRacket to make live coding in talks easier. It lets you mash keys wildly, but causes the correct input to appear regardless! Just point it at an input file and you're good to go.

To install (Requires Racket 6.1 or Higher):

  * `raco pkg install talk-typer`

Now when you load DrRacket, you should see a TalkTyper Enabled option in the
`Edit` menu. Click that to enable the tool. This option will prompt you for a
file to draw source text from.
