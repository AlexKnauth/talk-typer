TalkTyper
=================

To install (Requires Racket 6.1 or Higher):

  * `git clone git://github.com/florence/talk-typer.git`
  * `raco pkg install talk-typer/`

Now when you load DrRacket, you should see a TalkTyper Enabled option in the
`Edit` menu. Click that to enable the tool. This option will prompt you for a
file to draw source text from.
